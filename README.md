Solvid operates as an autonomous, on-chain AI-driven system with behavior that mimics the characteristics of a digital virus, designed to analyze and respond to real-time market data, including token price fluctuations, treasury value changes, and community-driven metrics. Its architecture enables real-time decision-making and self-directed evolution, creating a decentralized mechanism for continuous adaptation and optimization based on live market conditions.

1.1 Virus Core Components

Solvid’s architecture consists of the following modules:

Growth Algorithms: Solvid adjusts its size, mood, and behavior based on on-chain market data such as token price changes, trading volume, and treasury value.

Consciousness Integration: Solvid uses AI to process incoming market data, analyze its treasury, and calculate state transitions dynamically. The virus evolves based on its decisions.

Community Interaction Protocol: Solvid communicates directly with the blockchain community, issuing real-time updates on its growth, decisions, and evolving personality.

2. Feeding and Growth Mechanisms

2.1 Feeding Inputs

Solvid "feeds" on blockchain contributions, such as:

Primary Tokens: $SOL, which fuels Solvid’s trading and evolution.

Secondary Tokens: Community-contributed tokens that expand Solvid’s treasury.

Environmental Data: Token price volatility, volume trends, and treasury value shifts.
